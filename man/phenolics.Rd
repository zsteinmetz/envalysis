\title{Degradation of phenolic compounds by Steinmetz et al. (2019)}
\format{
A list containing two \code{\link[base]{data.frame}}s.

\code{seq} is a data frame with 160 rows and 6 columns with information on:

\describe{
  \item{Compound}{name of the phenolic compound}
  \item{Type}{sample type}
  \item{Batch}{number of the extraction batch}
  \item{Name}{sample name}
  \item{Area}{integrated peak area}
  \item{Spec Conc}{specified/nominal concentration [mg/L] of standards}
}

\code{samples} is a data frame with 42 rows and 9 columns with information
on:

\describe{
  \item{Name}{sample name; same as in \code{seq}}
  \item{Day}{day of the incubation experiment}
  \item{Lighting}{lighting conditions of the sample (dark/UV)}
  \item{Sterilization}{if the sample was sterilized prior incubation}
  \item{Treatment}{treatment name (Biogradation/Photooxidation)}
  \item{Replicate}{replicate number}
  \item{Weight}{sample weight [g]}
  \item{Extract}{extract volume [mL]}
  \item{Dilution}{dilution factor}
}
}
\description{
The sample data is stored in a list consisting of two
\code{\link[base]{data.frame}}s: a sequence table (\code{seq}) and a sample
table (\code{samples}).

The sequence table contains gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry measurement 
data of two phenolic compounds, these are tyrosol and vanillin. Besides the
samples, standard mixtures and extraction blanks were acquired in three
separate analysis batches. Each measurement resulted in an integrated peak
area.

The sample table describes the samples' origin from a 29-day degradation
experiment, in which the phenolic compounds were either degraded in the dark
by the native soil microbial community or photooxidized under UV irradiation.
The samples were processed in threefold replication. Their weight [g], the
volume [mL] of extract solution, and the dilution factor were recorded.
