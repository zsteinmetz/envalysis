Description: Small toolbox for data analyses in environmental chemistry and
    ecotoxicology. Provides, e.g., calibration() to calculate calibration curves
    and corresponding limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs)
    according to German DIN 32645:2008-11. texture() makes it easy to estimate
    soil particle size distributions from hydrometer measurements (ASTM
    D422-63(2007)e2).
